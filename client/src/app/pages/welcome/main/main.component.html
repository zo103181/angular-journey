        I want to work more with Angular and figured this application would be a perfect way to get started. My goal
        is to document this journey on <a href="https://medium.com/@zrolson" target="_blank"
          class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Medium</a>, share my
        experiences, and get input and direction from my fellow peers. My current plan is to tackle a small part of the
        application every two weeks and have a story written / published on or before that Sunday. I hope you will join
        me on this journey!
